1. install rpm-build 
yum -y install rpm-build make gcc git 

2. Build envioronement for 
mkdir -p /root/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}

3. change directories to the SOURCES directories
cd SOURCES
	# This is where we put the binaries (tar.gz) or the scripts (.sh)
	# These are the raw materials we will use for creating the rpm 
	# when you create a script ex. "Nagios.sh"  you have to make it into a tarball in order for our .spec file to be able to read it. 
	
	Example
tar -cvzf nagios.tar.gz nagios.sh  		# nagios.sh is the script we just built and placed in the SOURCE folder 
  
4. Change directories to the SPECS directoy edit the .spec file
	# this file is what tells us what to do with our raw materials 
	# edit the file  to match our SOURCE file 

5. use the rpmbuild command to create the RPM
rpmbuild -v -bb --clean SPECS/nagios.spec
	# this points to the .spec file in the SPEC directory
	# this will be stored in the BUILD directory

6. Change directories to the BUILD directory and issue an ls -l command to check for your file. 
cd BUILD 
ls -l 

7. After the RPM has been built you can issue a yum command to install it in your machine
yum install -y "RPM name"
